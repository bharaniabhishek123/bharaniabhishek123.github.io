### What to buy in these market crash based on my judgement. It's being center of my discussion now a days to identify best stocks in the bear market. I will try to document all my thoughts for my own use in these post.


Sector-wise if we see this , the coronavirus and tensions between russia and saudi arabia had impacted the most to Airlines, Oil & Energy, Export, Hotels. Due to sudden volatility and drop in market, central bank reduced the interest rates to 0. This in-turn will impacted Financial (Banks and other lendors). Now the DJIA average is down by around 45% from all time-high of 29,000 to 20,000.
