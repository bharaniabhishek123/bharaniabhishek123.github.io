## Graph Theory 

A graph G =  (V,E) has collection of Vertex V and ordered or un-ordered edges E. There are two popular data structures to store the graph i.e. Adjacency list and Adacency Matrix. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. 

Item               | Adj List   |  Adj Matrix |  Time Complexity | 
|-----------------:|:----------:|:------------:|:----------------|
Finding between vertex  |O(N) | O(1) | |
Finding degree of vertex | O(N) | O(N^2) | |
Memory  | O(M+N) | O(N^2) ||
Traverse graph | O(N+M) | O(N^2) ||
Edge insertion or deletion | O(N) | O(1) || 

Given Edge list , to covert and create adj list (for directed graph)

```
adj_list = [[] for _ in range(num_vertex)]
# edge list = [[1,0], [0,1]]
for (src, dest) in edge_list:
    adj_list[src].append(dest)

```
